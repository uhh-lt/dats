Status: draft

## Persona

CultCryo researcher performing weekly annotation analysis.

## Journey Steps

1. Enters annotation search view.
2. Selects overlap metric (exact, partial, within, contains).
3. Selects document IDs to search.
4. Chooses code A and code B.
5. Optionally filters by annotator ID.
6. Runs search.
7. Reviews results list (grouping optional, default by document).
8. Clicks a result to open the source document with highlighted spans.
9. Exports or saves insights as needed.

## Pain Points Addressed

- No overlap search in current UI.
- Export-and-script workflow is not feasible for most users.

## Success Moments

- Sees correct overlapping annotations within 30 seconds.
- Visual cue makes the overlap type and A/B direction obvious.
- Quickly navigates to spans in context.
