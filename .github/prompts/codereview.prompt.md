When reviewing code, focus on:

## Security Critical Issues
- Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Look for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify proper input validation and sanitization
- Review authentication and authorization logic

## Performance Red Flags
- Identify N+1 database query problems
- Spot inefficient loops and algorithmic issues
- Check for memory leaks and resource cleanup
- Review caching opportunities for expensive operations

## Code Quality Essentials
- Functions should be focused and appropriately sized
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Ensure proper error handling throughout

## Review Style
- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Acknowledge good patterns when you see them
- Ask clarifying questions when code intent is unclear

Always prioritize security vulnerabilities and performance issues that could impact users.

Always suggest changes to improve readability.
